    <p>Deoxyribonucliec Acid(DNA) was discovered by a Swiss biologist called Johann 
        Friedrich Miescher. It was first isolated by him in the year 1869. He was
        carrying out experiments using salt solution to understand what made up  a 
        white blood cell when he noticed that when he added acid to a solution of cells, a 
        substance seprated from the solution and this substance dissolved again when 
        alkali was added. He also noticed that this substance had different properties from
        the protiens which he had studied. <br>He called the substance "nuclein" because
        it came from the cell nuclei.

    <h2>Isolation of the 5 nucleotide</h2>
    <p>In 1881, Albrecht Kossel, a German biochemist, who studied and gained 
        a better understnding of this substance called it a <span><b>"nucleic acid"</b>
            </span> and
        gave a chemical name as Deoxyribonucliec(DNA).
        He also  isolated the five nucleotide bases that are the building blocks 
        of <acronym title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid">DNA</acronym> and
        <abbr title="Ribonucleic Acid">RNA</abbr> which are;<span> <b>Adenine,
            Cytosine, Guanine, Thymine
        </b> and <b>Uracil</b></span>
